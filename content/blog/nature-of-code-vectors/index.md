This week I modified my previous project to use vectors and also added a few more interactions. Three sliders now control wiggle amount (random motion), horizontal drift, and vertical drift. Using them together allows for more ways to generate a composition. A square "frame" that comes into view once shapes are placed changes the musical chord when clicked. Holding it down will increase its size, and I would like to add a sonic element as well.
