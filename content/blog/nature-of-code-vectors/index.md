This week I modified my previous project to use vectors and also added a few more interactions. Three sliders now control wiggle amount (random motion), horizontal drift, and vertical drift -- all of which affect all shapes equally. Using them together allows for more different "brushstrokes".

A square "frame" appears once shapes have been placed. Clicking it changes the musical chord and holding it down increases its size -- I would like to add a sonic element to this interaction as well.
