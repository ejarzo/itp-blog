For my timbre study I created an [Additive Synth](https://additive-synth.netlify.app/).

(NOTE: docs are still in progress).

Controls: Space bar to play. Move mouse left and right to change chords. Adjust synth parameters with the sliders. Oscillator 1 controls the overall envelope - all other oscillators (including noise) are routed through Oscillator 1.

[Try it out](https://additive-synth.netlify.app/) or [view the source](https://github.com/ejarzo/additive-synth).
