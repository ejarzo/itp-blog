[Open sketch](https://editor.p5js.org/ejarzo/sketches/SxC9dZDpJ)

This week I modified my [simulation project](/nature-of-code-simulation) to incorporate flocking behaviors. The three sliders at the bottom control the particles' separation, alignment, and cohesion. I also added text when and where the sounds occur, so that the sketch can be experienced without hearing -- an exercise as part of my "Sound Art: Listening" class.
