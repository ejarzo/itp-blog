For my final project I will be porting my [Abacusynth](/nature-of-code-oscillation) project (which I made during the Oscillation week) into a Max/MSP plugin for Ableton Live. [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/) is a popular music making software and [Max](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/max-for-live/) is a visual programming language used for mainly audio and visual applications. It integrates with Ableton and provides a platform to extend or create custom effects and instruments that can be used in the software, and also be shared/downloaded by others. I want to take my initial idea and turn it into something that can be used in the music-making workflow -- something that can be played/recorded with a keyboard or MIDI device in your Ableton session. The one feature I want to add is polyphony -- the ability to play multiple notes at once.

I will present this project in tandem with my [polygonal sequencer](/mixd-polygonal-sequencer/) as the final project for two of my other classes _Music Interaction Design_ and _Signals, Calls and Marches_.
